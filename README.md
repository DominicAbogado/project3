# In-School Workshop Builder

## Goals
* Recreate my company website: 
[Engineering Outreach](http://outreach.engineering.utoronto.ca/) 
* Our organization runs a program called In-School Workshops which allow TDSB teachers to request engineering undergraduate instructors to come to their classroom and deliver a hands-on engineering activities.
* The app would allow TDSB teachers to easily sort through our In-School Workshop Brochure and select a workshop that works best for their class.
* Once the teacher finds the workshops, they will be able to login to their TDSB account and request the workshops, dates, and times for the program.
* When the request is made, it will create a templated email that will be sent to the admins
